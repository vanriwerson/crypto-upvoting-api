# Crypto Upvoting API
> This application consists of a ranking of cryptocurrencies generated by user votes.

## Technologies
To this app, I used a mySQL to persist data, Docker-compose to create and run a mySQL instance, Golang for the API and React.js in front-end app.

## Running the application
> - You can run this project from his root directory.
> - This project requires docker and docker-compose for his execution.

1. Run the database instance with:
~~~bash
npm run db:up
~~~
2. Run the script `database/sql/migrations.sql` in your DBMS (i've used MySQL Workbench) to generate database structure.
3. Run the script `database/sql/migrations.sql` in your DBMS to populate the tables previously created.
4. Adjust the environment variables according the `database/docker-compose.yml` by creating a .env file (view `api/.env.example`).
5. Run the API with:
~~~bash
npm run api:up
~~~
(To-do: Complements about fron-end execution)
